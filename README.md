## üì∏ Project Context

> *Stolen Life is a unique and poignant documentary art photo project that shows the consequences of the full-scale invasion of Russia on the civilians of Ukraine. The heroes stand in front of their ruined houses, naked, like newborns, looking into the unknown. People of different age, social status, and gender are now facing the same adversity.*

The website serves as a **digital exhibition space**, making the project accessible worldwide.
